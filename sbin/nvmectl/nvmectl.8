.Sh DESCRIPTION
NVM Express (NVMe) is a storage protocol standard, for SSDs and other
high-speed storage devices over PCI Express.
.Ss logpage
The logpage command knows how to print log pages of various types.
It also knows about vendor specific log pages from hgst/wdc and intel.
Page 0xc1 for hgst/wdc contains the advanced smart information about
the drive.
Page 0xc1 is read latency stats for intel.
Page 0xc2 is write latency stats for intel.
Page 0xc5 is temperature stats for intel.
Page 0xca is advanced smart information for intel.
.Pp
Specifying
.Fl p
.Ic help
will list all valid vendors and pages.
.Fl x
will print the page as hex.
.Fl b
will print the binary data for the page.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
.Dl nvmectl identify /dev/sd0c
.Pp
Display a human-readable summary of the IDENTIFY_CONTROLLER data of the
NVMe controller hosting sd0.
.Pp
.Dl nvmectl identify -x -v sd0c
.Pp
Display an hexadecimal dump of the sd0c
.Dv IDENTIFY_NAMESPACE
data for namespace 1.
.Pp
.Dl nvmectl logpage -p 1 /dev/sd0c
.Pp
Display a human-readable summary of the NVMe controller's Error Information Log.
Log pages defined by the NVMe specification include
Error Information Log (ID=1),
SMART/Health Information Log (ID=2),
and
Firmware Slot Log (ID=3).
.Pp
.Dl nvmectl logpage -p 0xc1 -v wdc /dev/sd0c
.Pp
Display a human-readable summary of the nvme0's wdc-specific advanced
SMART data.
.Pp
.Dl nvmectl logpage -p 1 -x /dev/sd0c
.Pp
Display a hexadecimal dump of the NVMe controller's Error Information Log.
.Pp
.Dl nvmectl logpage -p 0xcb -b /dev/sd0c > /tmp/page-cb.bin
.Pp
Print the contents of vendor specific page 0xcb as binary data on
standard out.
Redirect it to a temporary file.
.Pp
.Dl nvmectl power -l /dev/sd0c
.Pp
List all the current power modes.
.Pp
.Dl nvmectl power -p 3 /dev/sd0c
.Pp
Set the current power mode.
.Pp
.Dl nvmectl power /dev/sd0c
.Pp
Get the current power mode.
